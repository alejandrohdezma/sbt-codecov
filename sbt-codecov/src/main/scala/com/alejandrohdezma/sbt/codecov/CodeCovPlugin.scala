/**
 * Companion plugin to `sbt-scoverage` to automatically upload coverage reports
 * to Codecov after successfully running all test configurations.
 *
 * The plugin adds the following tasks/commands/settings:
 *
 *  - '''codecovProcess''': This setting contains the process that should be executed in
 *  order to upload coverage data to Codecov. Defaults to bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -Z.
 *  - '''retrieveCoverage''': This task uploads coverage data to Codecov using the process
 *  setting codecovProcess.
 *  - '''codecovUpload''': Task used to generate coverage report. Defaults to sbt-scoverage's
 *  coverageAggregate. This task can be skipped if SBT is run containing the system property
 *  "skip.coverage" set to "true".
 *  - '''testCovered''': This command runs the test task with cross-building in all the configurations
 *  that enable it while recovering coverage data from them. After a successful execution, uploads the
 *  coverage data to Codecov using the codecovUpload task.
