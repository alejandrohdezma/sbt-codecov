/**
 * Companion plugin to `sbt-scoverage` to automatically upload coverage reports
 * to Codecov after successfully running all test configurations.
 *
 * The plugin adds the following tasks/commands/settings:
 *
 *  - '''codecovProcess''': Process that should be executed in order to upload
 * coverage data to Codecov. Defaults to `bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)`.
 *  - '''retrieveCoverage''': Task used to generate coverage report. Defaults to
 * sbt-scoverage's `coverageAggregate`.
 *  - '''codecovUpload''': Uploads coverage data to Codecov using the process set
 * in `codecovProcess`.
 *  - '''testCovered''': Runs the test task in all the configurations that enabled
 * it while recovering coverage data from them. After a successful execution,
 * uploads the coverage data to Codecov using the `codecovUpload` task.
